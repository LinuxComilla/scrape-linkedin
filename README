# Scrape Linkedin Search Results

This project was created in order to scrape data for a research project on consultants and entrepreneurship rates.

The code present in this project can be used to scrape search result data from linked in, so I figured the code might be
helpful to those wanting to use scRUBYt (http://scrubyt.org/). 

All scRUBYt code can be found in the Linkedin class.

The LinkedinScraper class consists of helpers that access the Linkedin class in order to store the data locally in XML files
and read the stored XML data into the database.
